# Data folder

This folder is used to save every data file used by the project and the tutorials (when you use a new dataset, it is loaded from [scyan_data](https://github.com/MICS-Lab/scyan_data) and saved in this folder).

See the [documentation](https://mics-lab.github.io/scyan/advanced/data/) for more details or explanations for creating your own dataset.
