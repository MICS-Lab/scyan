Scyan stands for **S**ingle-cell **Cy**tometry **A**nnotation **N**etwork. Based on biological knowledge prior, it provides a fast cell population annotation without requiring any training label. Scyan is an interpretable model that also corrects batch-effect and can be used for debarcoding / cell sampling / population discovery.

# Documentation

The [complete documentation can be found here](https://mics_biomathematics.pages.centralesupelec.fr/biomaths/scyan/). It contains installation guidelines, tutorials, a description of the API, etc.

# Overview

Scyan is a Bayesian probabilistic model composed of a deep invertible neural network called a normalizing flow (the function $f_{\phi}$). It maps a latent distribution of cell expressions into the empirical distribution of cell expressions. This cell distribution is a mixture of gaussian-like distributions representing the sum of a cell-specific and a population-specific term. Also, interpretability and batch effect correction are based on the model latent space â€” more details in the article's Methods section.

# Getting started

Scyan can be installed on every OS with `pip` or [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).
The only requirement is to have `python` installed (>=3.8, <3.11). Still, we advise using `python=3.9`, the python version for which `scyan` is the more stable.

## Install with PyPI

Available after publication

## Install locally

> Advice (optional): We advise creating a new environment via a package manager (except if you use Poetry, which will automatically create the environment). For instance, you can create a new `conda` environment:
>
> ```bash
> conda create --name scyan python=3.9
> conda activate scyan
> ```

Clone the repository and move to its root:

```bash
git clone git@gitlab-research.centralesupelec.fr:mics_biomathematics/biomaths/scyan.git
cd scyan
```

You can install it with `pip` or `poetry`; choose one among the following (it should take at most a few minutes):

```bash
pip install -e '.[dev,docs,discovery]'  # pip installation in editable mode
pip install .                           # pip minimal installation (package only)
poetry install -E 'dev docs discovery'  # poetry installation in editable mode
```

## Basic usage

```py
import scyan

adata, marker_pop_matrix = scyan.data.load("aml")

model = scyan.Scyan(adata, marker_pop_matrix)
model.fit()
model.predict()
```

The latter should run in approximately 40 seconds (once the dataset was loaded).
For more usage demo, read the [tutorials](https://mics_biomathematics.pages.centralesupelec.fr/biomaths/scyan/tutorials/usage/) or the complete [documentation](https://mics_biomathematics.pages.centralesupelec.fr/biomaths/scyan/).

# Technical description

Scyan is a **Python** library based on:

- _Pytorch_, a deep learning framework
- _AnnData_, a data library that works nicely with single-cell data
- _Pytorch Lighning_, for model training
- _Hydra_, for project configuration
- _Weight & Biases_, for model monitoring
