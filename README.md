Scyan stands for **S**ingle-cell **Cy**tometry **A**nnotation **N**etwork. Based on biological knowledge prior, it provides a fast cell population annotation without requiring any training label. Scyan is an interpretable model that also corrects batch-effect and can be used for debarcoding, cell sampling, and population discovery.

# Documentation

The [complete documentation can be found here](https://mics-lab.github.io/scyan/). It contains installation guidelines, tutorials, a description of the API, etc.

# Overview

Scyan is a Bayesian probabilistic model composed of a deep invertible neural network called a normalizing flow (the function $f_{\phi}$). It maps a latent distribution of cell expressions into the empirical distribution of cell expressions. This cell distribution is a mixture of gaussian-like distributions representing the sum of a cell-specific and a population-specific term. Also, interpretability and batch effect correction are based on the model latent space — more details in the article's Methods section.

# Getting started

Scyan can be installed on every OS with `pip` or [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

On macOS / Linux, `python>=3.8,<3.11` is required, while `python>=3.8,<3.10` is required on Windows. The preferred Python version is `3.9`.

## Install from PyPI (recommended)

```bash
pip install scyan
```

## Install locally (if you want to contribute)

> Advice (optional): We advise creating a new environment via a package manager (except if you use Poetry, which will automatically create the environment). For instance, you can create a new `conda` environment:
>
> ```bash
> conda create --name scyan python=3.9
> conda activate scyan
> ```

Clone the repository and move to its root:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MICS-Lab/scyan.git
cd scyan
```

Choose one of the following, depending on your needs (it should take at most a few minutes):

```bash
pip install .                            # pip minimal installation (library only)
pip install -e .                         # pip installation in editable mode
pip install -e '.[dev,hydra,discovery]'  # pip installation with all the extras
poetry install -E 'dev hydra discovery'  # poetry installation with all the extras
```

## Basic usage / Demo

```py
import scyan

adata, table = scyan.data.load("aml") # Automatic loading

model = scyan.Scyan(adata, table)
model.fit()
model.predict()
```

This code should run in approximately 40 seconds (once the dataset is loaded).
For more usage demo, read the [tutorials](https://mics-lab.github.io/scyan/tutorials/usage/) or the complete [documentation](https://mics-lab.github.io/scyan/).

# Technical description

Scyan is a **Python** library based on:

- [_AnnData_](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a data library that works nicely with single-cell data
- [_Pytorch_](https://pytorch.org/), a deep learning framework
- [_Pytorch Lightning_](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/), for model training

Optionally, it also supports:
- [_Hydra_](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/), for project configuration
- [_Weight & Biases_](https://wandb.ai/site), for model monitoring
