# Contributing to *Scyan*

Contributions are welcome as we aim to continue improving `scyan`. For instance, you can contribute by:

- Opening an issue
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Making a Pull Request (PR)

If you want to open a PR, follow the following instructions.

## Making a Pull Request (PR)

To add some new code to **scyan**, you should:

1. Fork the repository
2. Install `scyan` in editable mode with the `dev` dependencies (see next section)
3. Create your personal branch from `main`
4. Implement your changes according to the 'Coding guidelines' below
5. Create a pull request on the `main` branch of the original repository. Add explanations about your developed features, and wait for discussion and validation of your pull request

## Installing `scyan` in editable mode

When contributing, installing `scyan` in editable mode is recommended. We also recommend installing the `dev` dependencies.

For that, you can use [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) as below:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/prism-oncology/scyan.git
cd scyan

uv sync --all-extras --dev   # all extras and dev dependencies
```

## Coding guidelines

### Styling and formatting

We use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) to run code quality controls before the commits. This will run `ruff` and others minor checks.


You can set it up at the root of the repository like this:
```sh
pre-commit install
```

Then, it will run the pre-commit automatically before each commit.

You can also run the pre-commit manually:
```sh
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Apart from this, we recommend to follow the standard styling conventions:
- Follow the [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) style guide.
- Provide meaningful names to all your variables and functions.
- Provide type hints to your function inputs/outputs.
- Add docstrings in the Google style.
- Try as much as possible to follow the same coding style as the rest of the repository.

### Testing

When create a pull request, tests are run automatically. But you can also run the tests yourself before making the PR. For that, run `pytest` at the root of the repository. You can also add new tests in the `./tests` directory.

To run the tests locally:

```sh
uv run pytest
```

### Documentation

You can update the documentation in the `./docs` directory. Refer to the [mkdocs-material documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) for more help.

To serve the documentation locally:

```sh
uv run mkdocs serve
```
