Scyan stands for **S**ingle-cell **Cy**tometry **A**nnotation **N**etwork. Based on biological knowledge prior, it provides a fast cell population annotation without requiring any training label. Scyan is an interpretable model that also corrects batch-effect and can be used for debarcoding, cell sampling, and population discovery.

## Overview

Scyan is a Bayesian probabilistic model composed of a deep invertible neural network called a normalizing flow (the function $f_{\phi}$). It maps a latent distribution of cell expressions into the empirical distribution of cell expressions. This cell distribution is a mixture of gaussian-like distributions representing the sum of a cell-specific and a population-specific term. Also, interpretability and batch effect correction are based on the model latent space â€” more details in the article's Methods section.

## Technical description

Scyan is a **Python** library based on:

- [_AnnData_](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a data library that works nicely with single-cell data
- [_Pytorch_](https://pytorch.org/), a deep learning framework
- [_Pytorch Lighning_](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/), for model training

Optionally, it also supports:

- [_Hydra_](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/), for project configuration
- [_Weight & Biases_](https://wandb.ai/site), for model monitoring
